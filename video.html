                 (flying horse), Chimera (combination of a lion, snake, and goat), Cerberus (three headed dog who guards the underworld),
                Cyclopes (one eyed giants), Hydra (monster with regenerating snake heads), Medusa (monster with snakes for hair) , griffins (half eagle and half lion), satyrs (half man and half goat), and nymphs.
                 Be introduced to the most famous of these characters in Greek myths such as Chiron and Polyphemus and hear about some of the exciting heroes in ancient Greek Mythology such as Perseus, Odysseus,
                and Bellerophon. The video is set up in format where students or children can guess the beast or creature that is hidden. After three clues, the students or children can see the answer and learn
