            <br>
            <p>In Japanese myth, oni are people who were so truly wicked in their lives that they transformed into demons 
                in hell. Some were even bad enough to be transformed while still alive! These giant, scary monsters with 
                red or blue skin, horns, and tusks are traditionally the servants of hell. They enact violent punishment on evil-doers 
                and will eat just about anything, including humans. While stories or 
                depictions of oni may vary, they are always seen as dangerous and powerful villains.</p>
