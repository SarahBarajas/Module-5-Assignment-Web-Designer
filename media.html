            <p class="external-css">Most often depicted as a giant with one eye, the cyclops (which means ‘circle-eyed’) 
                first appeared in ancient Greek mythology. Somewhat lesser known than the classic Greek gods, 
                the cyclopes lived in isolation and tended sheep or goats without any government, society, or 
                community. While scorned for their lawlessness, it was the cyclopes who created Zeus’ thunderbolts,
                Hades' helmet which made the wearer invisible, Poseidon’s trident, and Artemis’ silver bow. So, we
                should give them some credit for their creativity</p>

             are widely known and easily recognizable, especially if you’ve ever had a certain 
                breakfast cereal. While leprechauns originated in medieval Irish folklore, they did not become
                prominent until much later. Smaller, diminutive human-like beings, leprechauns are known to be 
                solitary creatures with a love for mischief and practical jokes. Interestingly enough, according 
                to folktales, a leprechaun’s appearance and dress could change by region!</p>

        </div>
            <p class="external-css">When you think of a gnome, you might picture your standard garden gnome: a small, cheerful 
                guardian of flora and fauna. In some senses, this depiction isn’t entirely incorrect. In European
                 folklore, dwarf-like earth spirits called gnomes guarded underground treasures. Medieval myths 
                 depicted gnomes as creatures resembling little old men, often with hunched over backs.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="images/faries.webp" alt="Faeries"width="300" height="300">
        </div>
            <p class="external-css">Faeries, also known as fairies, fey, or fae, can be traced back to Old French medieval romance stories. 
                These supernatural creatures or spirits are popular across a wide variety of myths, legends, and stories,
                leading up to the present day. Generally, when we think of fairies or faeries, we think of small, winged,
                magical creatures. However, faeries were rarely depicted with wings outside of Victorian artwork.
                In folk tales, faeries flew using magic and occasionally caught a ride on the back of a friendly bird!</p>

            <h6>Mermaid</h6>
            <div style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="images/mermaids.jfif" alt="Mermaids"width="300" height="300">
            </div>
            <p class="external-css">Mermaids have a unique allure that has captivated people throughout history.
                Myths of half-human, half-fish creatures can be traced all the way back to ancient Babylon.
                Similarly, merpeople are featured in Syrian, Polynesian, and Greek mythology. While some cultures
                depicted mermaids as beautiful and romantic (in Irish folklore, mermaids could transform into 
                human form and marry humans), sometimes mermaid stories took on a more sinister tone where they were capable of foretelling and bringing disaster.</p>
